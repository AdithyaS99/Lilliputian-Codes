# Lilliputian-Codes
This repository contains various use cases / source codes. The task is to shorten the code. In doing so, optimisation / time and space complexity doesn't play any role. The source need to reduce to the least number of characters. Make the code short, shorter, shortest, more shortest, most shortest, and (most) ^ infinity .... shortest.
