## Welcome to the world of Lilliputs of Code :computer:

<hr size="2px">

### <span style="color: orange">Lilliputians of code </span>

The main aim of this repository is to come down to shortest code snippet. In the process of doing so, one can ignore time and space 
complexity. Make sure the code works (so that you can drink some coffee) and it has the least characters (as caffeine is not good for 
health as well).


# Repository Directory structure:

-  Root Directory (Lilliputian-Codes) 
-  Use Cases
-  Lilliput code files (waiting for you)

# Example of King of Lilliput Code

## Print its own source code:
```
print(open(__file__).read()) 
```
### When the above code will be run in python3, the same code will be the output

- Output of the program: 

```
print(open(__file__).read()) 
```

# Additional Points  :memo:
- Sometimes one-liner codes can be longer than multi-liner in consideration of number of characaters.
- If you are just copying & pasting it from some source, don't forget to refer & acknowledge the site.
- <b>NOTE:</b> Refering from some other source is a good practice to improve your code. 
- You can ulter the print commands.
  1) For example: print("Yes, the number is present in the array") can be written as print("Yes") {to decrease count of characters} 
- In some of the use cases, sample code is given. It is just for reference, it's not necessary to shorten that particular code itself if in case if it is an algorithm based usecase. It means that you can use any techniques for use cases like linear search, binary search etc. But in case of a random specific code snippet given, shorten that particular code itself.

## Instead of doing this:
```
tmp = y
y = x
x = tmp
```
## Do this:
```
x,y=y,x
```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Instead of:
```
a = Function_name(value)
print(a)
```
## Do this:
```
print(Function_name(value))
```
