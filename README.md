### Lilliputians of code

The main aim of this repository is to come down to shortest code snippet. In the process of doing so, one can ignore time and space 
complexity. Make sure the code works (so that you can drink some coffee) and it has the least characters (as caffeine is not good for 
health as well).


# Repository Directory structure:

-  Root Directory (Lilliputian-Codes) 
-  Use Case 
-  Lilliput code files (waiting for you)
